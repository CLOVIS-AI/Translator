# Translator
A little class for making the availability of a program in different languages extremly easy !

The goal of this project is to allow small-sized translations to work with a Processing program : 
after a really simple installation, you will be able to make your project available in multiple
languages.

This project was originally created for StatsReader, and is published as a stand-alone 'library'
for convenience.

More can be read about this project on my blog, clovis-cyclone.blogspot.fr (despite the .fr, it's 
in english).
